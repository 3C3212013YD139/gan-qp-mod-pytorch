# gan-qp-mod-pytorch
A gan-qp implementation modified by me  
Only 128x128 img size.  

I am training in my anime avatar dataset.  
Maybe my dataset is too small(3.7w img) and the effect is not good.  

The last layer of the generator of Model 1 does not use any activation functions.  
There are variegated color in the resulting image.  
Later replaced with the Tanh activation function, the variegated color is gone. 

The samples folder contains images generated by my training process.  

model_1 16000 iters

# Modify place
Model_1  
Fewer convolution kernel.  
Added minibatch_stddev layer.  
Fixup init.  

Model_2  
Fewer convolution kernel.  
Added minibatch_stddev layer.  
Fixup init.  
Replace DeConv with Upsample+Conv.  

Model_3  
Just replace 5x5 convolution to 3x3 convolution.

# Dependent
python 3.7.1  
pytorch 1.0.1  
numpy 1.16.2  
imageio  
opencv-python  

# Generate an image
if you want to try model_1  
just run  
```
python3 test.py
```

if you want to try model_2  
just run  
```
python3 test2.py
```

# Train on you dataset
For Model 1  
Delete all weight.  
edit file gan-qp-torch.py  
change  
```
img_dir = r'../datasets/faces/*.jpg'
```
to
```
img_dir = r'your/datasets/path/*.jpg'
```
change batch_size (line 144. Requires batch_size is multiple of 4 because minibatch_stddev.  
if you VRAM is 3GB, I suggest set to 12  
save file  
run  
```
python3 gan-qp-torch.py
```
Then the training started.  
Model 2 operations are similar to the above.
